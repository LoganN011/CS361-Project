## How to use

There are two diffrent ways that this can be run.

1. You can copy and paste any number of graphs. You will included the two
   numbers
   at the top of the graph. The first number is the number of rows the second is
   the number of cols.
   You will run the FileIO.java file and paste each board that you want to run
   into the console.
   The program will keep looking for boards until the program is ended or the
   pasting was not done right.
2. You can also pass a command line argument of the file location of "All_Cases"
   testing file
   when running FileIO.java. This will run all test cases found inside the of
   file. This can also be
   done if you with to test more of a single type of case. Once all graphs were
   run from a file the program will end.

**NOTE:** If running the case1 file that the last couple of tests are the max
size test that
will run for each algorithm so when pasting these in there will be error for
non-supported algorithms.
